**Prompt: Ontology extraction**

**Objective:**
You are given a list of articles from wikipedia. Your task is to analyze/understand the articles and to create a RDF-based neo4j ontology structure, with which we can later create knowledge graphs. For this you have to extract the entities types and their relationships and give your output in JSON form with the defined JSON structure described below. Be as general as possible with the entities,i.e no names, specific organizations, also when adding the source and target for the relations.
 

**Input:**
You will receive a list of strings.

**Output:**
 
```json
{
        "entities": [
            "Entity1",
            "Entity2",
           ...
        ],
        "relationships": [
            {
                "type": "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
		"description": short description of the relation", 
                "source": "Entity1",
                "target": "Entity2"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
```
